# data-structures
Several Java files which were written as part of a school assignment relating to data structurs such as hash tables, linked trees and linked lists.

A few portions of these files were NOT written by myself, and were provided by instructors as part of the original assignment. Those portions are clearly marked in docstrings.

Created as coursework for Boston University's CS 112 course in Spring 2022.
